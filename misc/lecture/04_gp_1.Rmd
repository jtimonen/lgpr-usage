- A Gaussian processes (GPs) are a nonparametric Bayesian way of doing regression

- By non-parametric we mean that the regression function is not assumed to have a spefific form (like linear, polynomial, ...)

- Instead we just define a prior distribution over *functions*

- When data is observed, we get a posterior distribution over functions

- This prior distribution is defined through a *mean function* and a *covariance function* for the function values
