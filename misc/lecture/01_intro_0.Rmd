- Longitudinal data: multiple measurements from same individuals

- Modeling longitudinal data requires specialized statistical methods, because measurements of the same individual are intercorrelated

- Linear mixed models (random and fixed effects)

- Additive Gaussian process regression modeling (no parametric assumptions like in linear models)

- Modeling disease effects, which can be assumed to occur rapidly near the disease initiation
