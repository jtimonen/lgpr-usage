- Longitudinal studies typically collect measurements of several variables, which can be
    * continuous (age, blood pressure)
    * discrete (number of sequencing reads for some gene)
    * categorical (sex, nationality)
    
- In addition to their type, the variables differ in how expensive and invasive they are to measure

- Statistical modeling is needed to obtain interpretable associations between the variables
    * helps in understanding disease development
    * can reduce future measurement costs
    
- Another goal can be to build a predictive model
