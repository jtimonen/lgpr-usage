- An underlying unobserved signal $f: \mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is linked to the measured responses $\boldsymbol{y}$ through a likelihood function, which is based on a statistical observation model. 

- The process $f$ is assumed to consist of $J$ low-dimensional additive components, so that 
$$
f(\boldsymbol{x}) = f^{(1)}(\boldsymbol{x}) + \ldots + f^{(J)}(\boldsymbol{x}),
$$
where each $f^{(j)}, j = 1, \ldots, J$ is a function of only one or two covariates. 

- Decomposition into additive components allows us to obtain interpretable covariate effects after fitting the model.
