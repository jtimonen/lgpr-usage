- The covariates are *Days* (time from beginning of experiment) and 
*Subject* (subject id)
- *Reaction* (reaction time in milliseconds) is our response variable

```{r, dat3}
library(lattice)
library(ggplot2)
library(lme4) # data is in this package
head(sleepstudy) # prints first 6 rows
```

- We plot the data

```{r, plot2, fig.width=8}
xyplot(Reaction ~ Days | Subject, sleepstudy, type = c("g","p","r"),
       index = function(x,y) coef(lm(y ~ x))[1],
       xlab = "Days of sleep deprivation",
       ylab = "Average reaction time (ms)", aspect = "xy")
```

- We fit a mixed model where *Subject* is a random effect

```{r, fit2, fig.width=8}
fit <- lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (Days|Subject), sleepstudy)
summary(fit)
```
