- The additive GP models have a lot of unknown parameters, such as 
    + the component magnitude parameters $\alpha_j$
    + kernel lengthscale parameters $\ell$
    + possible parameters of the observation model, e.g. noise variance
    
- They are assigned priors, and their posterior is sampled using the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler in [Stan](https://mc-stan.org)

- After fitting the model, we can study the inferred components, and how relevant different covariates are in explaining the response variable
