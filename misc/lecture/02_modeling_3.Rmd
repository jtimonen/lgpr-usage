- This is just to give an idea what kind of variables we might be dealing with
- One row is one observation, one column is one variable
- **y** is the response variable, others are covariates
- Notice that also subject **id** is a covariate
- We come back to **diseaseAge** later
```{r, dataframe, echo=FALSE}
print(dat[100:150,], row.names = FALSE)
```
