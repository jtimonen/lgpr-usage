- In a standard linear model
$$
\boldsymbol{y} = \boldsymbol{X} \color{darkgray}{\boldsymbol{w}} +  \boldsymbol{\epsilon}
$$
all effects $\color{darkgray}{\boldsymbol{w}}$ are fixed effects

- This might be ok, if we assume that data contains observations of all possible values of all **categorical covariates** (possible for example for sex/group)

- However, when the subject **id** is one covariate, this is not possible

- We can only assume that the observed individuals are a random sample from a population

- Therefore we want to model **id** as a random effect
