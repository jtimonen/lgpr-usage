The experiment is done in the following steps:

   - Run the shell script 01_lgpr.sh
   - It calls the R script 01_lgpr.R several times to repeat the experiment many times
   - 01_lgpr.R simulates one data set and fits the lgpr model
   - Running 01_post.R will fit the lme4 model to each data set and collect the results
