- Modeling longitudinal data requires specialized methods, because measurements of the same individual are intercorrelated

- (Generalized) linear mixed models have random effects (for example for subject id)

- Additive GP modeling with specialized kernels allows similar modeling but without parametric assumptions

- Disease effects can be assumed to occur near the disease initiation, and thus modeled using a non-stationary GP for the disease-related age

- Here we were always modeling one response variable at a time

- Next lecture: modeling multiple response variables simultaneously in  similar applications
