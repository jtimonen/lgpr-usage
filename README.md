# Demos and experiments using the lgpr package

## demos
The easiest way to study the demos is to open the *.html* files using any web browser or other software. The demos contain code blocks, which can be run in R if the `lgpr`package is installed. There are six different demos:
* `01_basic` - basic usage of the package
* `02_realdata` - modeling the classic orthodont and sleepstudy datasets
* `03_comparison` - comparison with linear mixed effect modeling
* `04_disease` - modeling nonstationary disease effects with different modeling options
* `05_nongaussian` - modeling discrete count data using a non-Gaussian observation model
* `06_predicting` - computing out-of-sample predictions

## experiments
Contains codes for reproducing the experiments in the manuscript.

* `1_lme4` - comparison with linear mixed effect modeling
* `2_longp` - comparison with longp
* `3_heter` - heterogeneous disease effect modeling
* `4_uncrt` - modeling uncertainty of disease onset
* `5_nb` - experiment with negative binomial distributed count data
* `6_proteomics_data` - real proteomics data set experiments
