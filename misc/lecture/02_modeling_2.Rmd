- Regression analysis can reveal associations between a *response variable* and *covariates*

- The response variable can be 
    * continuous (abundance of some protein in blood)
    * discrete (number of sequencing reads for some gene)
    * a proportion (percentage of methylated reads at some location)
    
- Covariates can be
    * continuous (age, blood pressure)
    * categorical (sex, nationality)
